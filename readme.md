# Student Management System

A simple **Java program** designed to manage student information and grades. This project demonstrates fundamental Java concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), constructors, methods, and working with `ArrayList`. It allows users to input student details, calculate average grades, and provide remarks based on performance.
